                            <p>The game's setting begins in Tamriel on the 389th year of the Third Era, 
                                when Emperor Uriel Septim VII summons his advisor and Imperial Battlemage Jagar 
                                Tharn over concerns of betrayal from within the court. It transpires that his concerns were justified 
                                when Tharn is revealed to be the traitor, magically trapping the Emperor and his general, Talin Warhaft, in another 
                                dimension.
                            </p>
                            <p>When Tharn proceeds to magically disguise himself as Emperor in order to usurp the throne, his conspiracy 
                                is witnessed by mage apprentice Ria Silmane, whom he murders before she can warn the Elder Council. 
                                Tharn then summons demon minions to replace the Emperor's Guard and in his disguise 
                                he sends the player character, a court official and subordinate of General Warhaft, 
                                to die in the Imperial dungeons.

                            <p>Daggerfall is set in the Iliac Bay, between the provinces of High Rock and Hammerfell. 
                                The player is sent here at the personal request of the Emperor. He wants the player to do two things: 
                                First, the player must free the ghost of King Lysandus from his earthly shackles; 
                                Second, the player must discover what happened to a letter from the Emperor to the former queen of Daggerfall. 
                                The letter reveals that Lysandus's mother, Nulfaga, knows the location of the Mantella, the key to resurrecting the first Numidium, 
                                a powerful brass golem. The emperor wants his spy to force Nulfaga into revealing the location of the Mantella so that the Blades can finish the reconstruction of the Numidium. 
                            </p>
                            <p>Through a series of mishaps and confusions the letter fell into the hands of an orc by the name of Gortworg. 
                                Not knowing what the Mantella is, Gortworg consults Mannimarco, the King of Worms (the leader of the Necromancers). 
                                During this time the Underking, who originally destroyed the first Numidium because of its misuse by Tiber Septim, 
                                is recuperating deep within a tomb of High Rock after expending so much energy destroying it the first time.

                            <p>While Morrowind contains many quests and storylines, 
                                the central plot revolves around The Tribunal, a triumvirate of god-like beings ruling over Morrowind, 
                                and their struggle against a former ally, the demigod Dagoth Ur and his Sixth House – 
                                a cult of followers stretching out from Red Mountain, the volcanic center of Vvardenfell, 
                                the island on which the game is set. Dagoth Ur has used the Heart of Lorkhan, an artifact of great power, 
                                to make himself immortal and now seeks to drive the Imperial Legion occupiers from Morrowind using his network of spies, 
                                as well as Akulakhan, an enormous mechanical golem powered by the Heart of Lorkhan. 
                            </p>
                            <p>After a storm and a strange dream vision, the player character (PC) begins in a town called Seyda Neen, 
                                fresh off a boat from a mainland prison, freed by the string-pulling of the current ruler of the Tamrielic Empire, 
                                Emperor Uriel Septim VII. The PC is given the task of meeting Caius Cosades, a member of the Blades, 
                                a secret group of spies and agents working for the Emperor and the Empire. 
                            </p>
                            <p>Cosades inducts the player into the Blades on the Emperor's orders and sets the player on various quests to uncover 
                                the mysterious disappearances and revelations that the citizens of Vvardenfell have experienced, particularly 
                                the Sixth House and the Ashlander prophecies of the Nerevarine. It is later revealed that the induction under Cosades, 
                                and the player's release from prison, was due to the Emperor's suspicion that the player might be the Nerevarine – 
                                a reincarnation of the legendary Dunmer hero Indoril Nerevar – or at least someone who would make a convincing impostor 
                                to use for political gain. The PC is tasked with uncovering the prophecies regarding the Nerevarine and to fulfill them 
                                to finally defeat Dagoth Ur and his Sixth House cult.

                            <p>Oblivion is set during the Third Era, six years after the events of The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, 
                                although it is not a direct sequel to it or any other game.
                                The game is set in Cyrodiil—a province of Tamriel, the continent on which all the games in the series have so far taken place.
                            </p>
                            <p>The story begins with the player imprisoned in a cell for an unknown crime. 
                                Emperor Uriel Septim VII, accompanied by Imperial bodyguards known as the Blades, 
                                arrives in the prison, fleeing from assassins who have murdered the emperor's three sons and are now targeting him. 
                                The emperor and the Blades reveal that the player's jail cell contains a secret entrance to a part of the city's sewer that functions as an escape route. 
                                Pardoned by the emperor, the player follows the group into the sewer, 
                                where they come under attack by assassins. The Blades' captain is cut down during the fighting that ensues. 
                                Knowing he is destined to die by the hands of the assassins, Uriel Septim entrusts the player with the Amulet of Kings, 
                                worn by the Septim emperors of Tamriel, and orders the player to take it to a man named Jauffre, the grandmaster of the Blades, at Weynon Priory. 
                                Immediately afterward, one of the assassins kills the emperor. The player escapes the sewer and heads out into the open world of Cyrodiil.
